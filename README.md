### Overview

For my second project I created a Full CRUD app called Visibly+ for plus-size people who have difficulty finding fashionable, sustainable, and stylish clothing in their size.

### Technologies Used

- Languages: Javascript, CSS, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose
- Design: Used Skeleton as a CSS Boilerplate
- Project Planning & User Stories: Notebook
- IDE: VS Code

### User Stories

- User is able to see an index of brand names and product images for each view page
- User is able to read about the purpose of the resource, Visibly+, on the index page
- User is able to click on the brand's product image, to open a new page that allows users to see more information about the brand (description, if the business is owned by person of color, if the business is sustainable, or if the business is a small business).
- Users can navigate to the brands social media page / website
- Users can edit and update the brand's page
- Users can create new brands via a form page, that will populate back into index page and generate the same data on the brand's page like the others

### Future Development
- Create a second model that includes items the store might carry 
- Create a community section where people can communicate with one another
- Clean up CSS
